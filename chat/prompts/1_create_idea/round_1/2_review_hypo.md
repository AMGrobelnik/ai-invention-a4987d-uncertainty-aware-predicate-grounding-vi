title: >-
  Uncertainty-Aware Predicate Grounding via Entropy-Regularized Optimal Transport for Neuro-Symbolic Text-to-Logic Translation
hypothesis: >-
  Formulating predicate grounding as an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem provides a principled way to quantify
  uncertainty in neuro-symbolic text-to-logic translation. The entropy of the optimal transport plan serves as a well-calibrated
  uncertainty measure that can be integrated into probabilistic logic programming (ProbLog) to enable uncertainty-aware reasoning.
  This approach reduces hallucinations compared to raw LLM generation while maintaining interpretable reasoning traces.
motivation: >-
  Neuro-symbolic text-to-logic translation systems face a fundamental challenge: predicate disambiguation. The same natural
  language term can map to different logical predicates depending on context, and incorrect mappings lead to reasoning errors
  and hallucinations. Existing approaches use either deterministic mappings (brittle) or neural probability distributions
  (uninterpretable). Optimal transport provides a principled mathematical framework to: (1) find the optimal matching between
  text terms and logic predicates, (2) quantify uncertainty via the entropy of the transport plan, and (3) integrate this
  uncertainty into probabilistic logic programming for robust reasoning. This is significant because it bridges the gap between
  neural flexibility and symbolic precision while providing interpretable uncertainty estimates.
assumptions:
- >-
  Predicates in the target logic program can be represented as points in a semantic space (via embeddings or LLM-based similarity).
- >-
  The optimal transport formulation (source distribution = text terms, target distribution = predicates, cost matrix = semantic
  distance) captures the predicate grounding problem adequately.
- >-
  Entropy regularization parameter (epsilon) in the Sinkhorn algorithm can be tuned to provide well-calibrated uncertainty
  estimates.
- >-
  ProbLog (or similar probabilistic logic programming language) can incorporate the uncertainty estimates from optimal transport
  to improve reasoning robustness.
- >-
  The computational cost of solving optimal transport (O(n^2) or O(n^2 log n) with Sinkhorn) is acceptable for short documents
  (~3000 characters).
investigation_approach: |-
  1. DATASET PREPARATION: Use RuleTaker and CLUTRR datasets for evaluation, plus custom annotated datasets with short documents.
  2. BASELINE IMPLEMENTATION: Implement neuro-symbolic pipeline with LLM (GPT-4o via OpenRouter) for text-to-FOL translation, SWI-Prolog for symbolic execution, and OpenCyc for taxonomic grounding.
  3. OPTIMAL TRANSPORT MODULE: Implement entropy-regularized optimal transport using the Sinkhorn algorithm. Compute cost matrix using LLM-based semantic similarity. Extract uncertainty as entropy of transport plan.
  4. PROBLOG INTEGRATION: Convert FOL to ProbLog, incorporating uncertainty estimates as predicate probabilities.
  5. EVALUATION: Compare against baselines (raw LLM, standard neuro-symbolic without uncertainty, standard RAG, chain-of-thought) on: (i) precision/recall of atomic fact extraction, (ii) accuracy of multi-hop reasoning, (iii) hallucination rate, (iv) quality of reasoning traces.
  6. ABLATION: Evaluate contribution of optimal transport uncertainty vs. deterministic predicate assignment.
success_criteria: |-
  1. The optimal transport-based pipeline achieves >5% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on RuleTaker/CLUTRR compared to deterministic predicate assignment.
  2. Hallucination rate (incorrect facts introduced during translation) is reduced by >20% compared to raw LLM generation.
  3. The entropy of the optimal transport plan correlates with actual translation error (Spearman correlation >0.3), demonstrating it's a well-calibrated uncertainty measure.
  4. Reasoning traces remain human-auditable (precision/recall of trace correctness >90%).
  5. Inference runs on commodity hardware (single GPU or CPU) within acceptable time (<30s per document).
related_works:
- >-
  CLOVER (Ryu et al., 2024): Uses compositional FOL translation with verification. Our approach differs by using optimal transport
  for uncertainty-aware predicate grounding, not just compositional translation with post-hoc verification.
- >-
  LINC (Sherborne et al., 2023): Uses LLM as semantic parser for FOL translation. Our approach adds a principled uncertainty
  quantification layer via optimal transport entropy, which LINC lacks.
- >-
  Optimal Transport for Cross-lingual Semantic Parsing (Sherborne et al., 2023): Uses optimal transport to align cross-lingual
  latent variables. Our work applies optimal transport to a different problem (predicate grounding in mono-lingual text-to-logic
  translation) and uses entropy regularization for uncertainty quantification, which the cross-lingual work does not.
- >-
  Neuro-Symbolic Predicate Invention (Sha et al., 2024): Uses clustering for predicate invention in visual scenes. Our approach
  focuses on predicate grounding (assigning terms to existing predicates) rather than predicate invention, and uses optimal
  transport instead of clustering.
- >-
  Multidimensional Uncertainty Quantification via Optimal Transport (Kotelevskii et al., 2025): Uses optimal transport for
  uncertainty quantification in ML. Our work applies this idea to neuro-symbolic text-to-logic translation, a domain not explored
  in the original paper.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis draws inspiration from three cross-field sources: (1) OPTIMAL TRANSPORT THEORY (economics/operations research):
  The problem of matching two distributions with minimal cost. In our context, matching text terms to logic predicates with
  minimal semantic distortion. (2) ENTROPY REGULARIZATION (statistical physics/information theory): Adding an entropy term
  to an optimization problem to control the 'sharpness' of the solution. In our context, using entropy to quantify uncertainty
  in the matching. (3) PROBABILISTIC LOGIC PROGRAMMING (logic programming/AI): Representing uncertainty in logic programs
  via probability distributions over possible worlds. In our context, using the optimal transport entropy to inform predicate
  probabilities in ProbLog.
terms:
- term: Optimal Transport
  definition: >-
    A mathematical framework for finding the most efficient way to transform one probability distribution into another, minimizing
    a given cost function. In our context, it matches text terms to logic predicates with minimal semantic distance.
- term: Entropy-Regularized Optimal Transport
  definition: >-
    A variant of optimal transport that adds an entropy term to the optimization objective. The solution is computed via the
    Sinkhorn algorithm, and the entropy of the resulting transport plan provides a natural uncertainty measure.
- term: Predicate Grounding
  definition: >-
    The task of mapping natural language terms (words/phrases) to formal logical predicates. For example, mapping 'is a cat'
    to the predicate cat(X) in FOL.
- term: ProbLog
  definition: >-
    A probabilistic logic programming language where facts and rules have associated probabilities. It allows for uncertain
    reasoning by computing the probability of queries given the probabilistic program.
- term: Neuro-Symbolic Text-to-Logic Translation
  definition: >-
    The task of converting unstructured natural language text into a formal logical representation (e.g., FOL, Prolog) using
    both neural (LLM) and symbolic (logic solver) components.
- term: Sinkhorn Algorithm
  definition: >-
    An iterative algorithm for solving entropy-regularized optimal transport problems. It alternates between scaling rows
    and columns of the cost matrix to satisfy marginal constraints.
- term: Transport Plan
  definition: >-
    The solution to an optimal transport problem: a matrix where entry (i,j) indicates the amount of 'mass' transferred from
    source i to target j. In our context, it indicates how strongly text term i is assigned to predicate j.
- term: Transport Plan Entropy
  definition: >-
    The Shannon entropy of the transport plan, treated as a probability distribution. High entropy = uncertain matching (mass
    spread across many predicates). Low entropy = confident matching (mass concentrated on one predicate).
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes using entropy-regularized optimal transport to formulate predicate grounding as a matching problem
  between text terms and logic predicates. The entropy of the optimal transport plan provides a principled uncertainty measure
  that is integrated into probabilistic logic programming (ProbLog) for uncertainty-aware reasoning. This reduces hallucinations
  while maintaining interpretable reasoning traces.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-15 04:08:36 UTC

```
### Goal

Develop an operational translation pipeline that converts unstructured
textual content (e.g., short legal documents, news articles, kids'
stories) into a formal first-order logic representation. The output
must be capable of (probabilistic) reasoning using a logic reasoner
(like Prolog), leveraging LLMs to dynamically resolve terminology,
concepts, and relations that are not well defined in the explicit text.

### Reviewer Scope

Limit the technical core to areas the reviewer can deeply evaluate.
Other fields are welcome for inspiration but should not host the
substantive contribution.

Reviewer-evaluable areas: semantic technologies, logic programming,
inductive logic programming, information retrieval, machine learning,
LLMs, deep learning, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs,
reasoning, and text data analytics.

The pipeline should ingest a short document (approx. 3000 characters)
and parse it into a structured, computable format. Methods may combine
an LLM acting as a semantic translation engine (mapping natural text
to first-order logic or Prolog predicates), a running logic
interpreter (like SWI-Prolog) for symbolic execution, and the
integration of upper ontologies like OpenCyc to supply necessary
background structure and taxonomic grounding. Furthermore, an LLM
should be deployed as a probabilistic reasoning engine to handle fuzzy
unifications, semantic similarities, and logical gaps where strict
symbolic matching fails due to language ambiguity.

Evaluation must be rigorous and compare the neuro-symbolic pipeline
against purely neural baselines (e.g., standard RAG, chain-of-thought
prompting) on standard logical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., RuleTaker,
CLUTRR) or custom annotated datasets. It must specifically measure:
(i) the precision and recall of atomic fact extraction directly from
the original document, and (ii) the accuracy of multi-hop fact
extraction and logical deductions that require synthesizing explicit
document facts with implicit common-sense knowledge.

Outputs must provide human-auditable trace-graphs of the reasoning
steps to clearly demonstrate the logical path taken.

Constraints: The pipeline must be highly reproducible on any short,
professionally written documents. Inference must be executable on
commodity hardware, and the system must report a quantified reduction
in hallucination rates compared to raw LLM generation.

### Publication

Target ACL Knowledge Extraction track as the primary venue, with
EMNLP or specialized neuro-symbolic AI conference tracks (e.g., NeSy)
as fallback targets.

### Things to Avoid

Avoid simplistic propositional logic translations of the text. Avoid
purely neural black-box systems that lack interpretable reasoning
traces. The substantive contribution must be an operational, hybrid
method for reasoning with textual content that explicitly minimizes
hallucinations.

description: "Comprehensive web research toolkit — use whenever a task needs MORE than a handful of WebSearch/WebFetch calls (multi-source literature reviews, deep verification across many pages, paper/PDF mining, cross-referencing claims, building bibliographies). Not for single quick lookups — use raw WebSearch/WebFetch for those. Adds aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction over HTML or PDFs (arXiv, journals) with context windows, beyond what WebFetch's lossy summary returns. Trigger: any extensive/comprehensive/deep research task, literature review, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arxiv, paper, PDF, exact quote, methodology, table value, regex."

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-research-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
