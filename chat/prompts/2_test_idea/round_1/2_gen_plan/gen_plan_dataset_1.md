title: >-
  Uncertainty-Aware Predicate Grounding via Entropy-Regularized Optimal Transport for Neuro-Symbolic Text-to-Logic Translation
hypothesis: >-
  Formulating predicate grounding as an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem provides a principled way to quantify
  uncertainty in neuro-symbolic text-to-logic translation. The entropy of the optimal transport plan serves as a well-calibrated
  uncertainty measure that can be integrated into probabilistic logic programming (ProbLog) to enable uncertainty-aware reasoning.
  This approach reduces hallucinations compared to raw LLM generation while maintaining interpretable reasoning traces.
motivation: >-
  Neuro-symbolic text-to-logic translation systems face a fundamental challenge: predicate disambiguation. The same natural
  language term can map to different logical predicates depending on context, and incorrect mappings lead to reasoning errors
  and hallucinations. Existing approaches use either deterministic mappings (brittle) or neural probability distributions
  (uninterpretable). Optimal transport provides a principled mathematical framework to: (1) find the optimal matching between
  text terms and logic predicates, (2) quantify uncertainty via the entropy of the transport plan, and (3) integrate this
  uncertainty into probabilistic logic programming for robust reasoning. This is significant because it bridges the gap between
  neural flexibility and symbolic precision while providing interpretable uncertainty estimates.
assumptions:
- >-
  Predicates in the target logic program can be represented as points in a semantic space (via embeddings or LLM-based similarity).
- >-
  The optimal transport formulation (source distribution = text terms, target distribution = predicates, cost matrix = semantic
  distance) captures the predicate grounding problem adequately.
- >-
  Entropy regularization parameter (epsilon) in the Sinkhorn algorithm can be tuned to provide well-calibrated uncertainty
  estimates.
- >-
  ProbLog (or similar probabilistic logic programming language) can incorporate the uncertainty estimates from optimal transport
  to improve reasoning robustness.
- >-
  The computational cost of solving optimal transport (O(n^2) or O(n^2 log n) with Sinkhorn) is acceptable for short documents
  (~3000 characters).
investigation_approach: |-
  1. DATASET PREPARATION: Use RuleTaker and CLUTRR datasets for evaluation, plus custom annotated datasets with short documents.
  2. BASELINE IMPLEMENTATION: Implement neuro-symbolic pipeline with LLM (GPT-4o via OpenRouter) for text-to-FOL translation, SWI-Prolog for symbolic execution, and OpenCyc for taxonomic grounding.
  3. OPTIMAL TRANSPORT MODULE: Implement entropy-regularized optimal transport using the Sinkhorn algorithm. Compute cost matrix using LLM-based semantic similarity. Extract uncertainty as entropy of transport plan.
  4. PROBLOG INTEGRATION: Convert FOL to ProbLog, incorporating uncertainty estimates as predicate probabilities.
  5. EVALUATION: Compare against baselines (raw LLM, standard neuro-symbolic without uncertainty, standard RAG, chain-of-thought) on: (i) precision/recall of atomic fact extraction, (ii) accuracy of multi-hop reasoning, (iii) hallucination rate, (iv) quality of reasoning traces.
  6. ABLATION: Evaluate contribution of optimal transport uncertainty vs. deterministic predicate assignment.
success_criteria: |-
  1. The optimal transport-based pipeline achieves >5% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on RuleTaker/CLUTRR compared to deterministic predicate assignment.
  2. Hallucination rate (incorrect facts introduced during translation) is reduced by >20% compared to raw LLM generation.
  3. The entropy of the optimal transport plan correlates with actual translation error (Spearman correlation >0.3), demonstrating it's a well-calibrated uncertainty measure.
  4. Reasoning traces remain human-auditable (precision/recall of trace correctness >90%).
  5. Inference runs on commodity hardware (single GPU or CPU) within acceptable time (<30s per document).
related_works:
- >-
  CLOVER (Ryu et al., 2024): Uses compositional FOL translation with verification. Our approach differs by using optimal transport
  for uncertainty-aware predicate grounding, not just compositional translation with post-hoc verification.
- >-
  LINC (Sherborne et al., 2023): Uses LLM as semantic parser for FOL translation. Our approach adds a principled uncertainty
  quantification layer via optimal transport entropy, which LINC lacks.
- >-
  Optimal Transport for Cross-lingual Semantic Parsing (Sherborne et al., 2023): Uses optimal transport to align cross-lingual
  latent variables. Our work applies optimal transport to a different problem (predicate grounding in mono-lingual text-to-logic
  translation) and uses entropy regularization for uncertainty quantification, which the cross-lingual work does not.
- >-
  Neuro-Symbolic Predicate Invention (Sha et al., 2024): Uses clustering for predicate invention in visual scenes. Our approach
  focuses on predicate grounding (assigning terms to existing predicates) rather than predicate invention, and uses optimal
  transport instead of clustering.
- >-
  Multidimensional Uncertainty Quantification via Optimal Transport (Kotelevskii et al., 2025): Uses optimal transport for
  uncertainty quantification in ML. Our work applies this idea to neuro-symbolic text-to-logic translation, a domain not explored
  in the original paper.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis draws inspiration from three cross-field sources: (1) OPTIMAL TRANSPORT THEORY (economics/operations research):
  The problem of matching two distributions with minimal cost. In our context, matching text terms to logic predicates with
  minimal semantic distortion. (2) ENTROPY REGULARIZATION (statistical physics/information theory): Adding an entropy term
  to an optimization problem to control the 'sharpness' of the solution. In our context, using entropy to quantify uncertainty
  in the matching. (3) PROBABILISTIC LOGIC PROGRAMMING (logic programming/AI): Representing uncertainty in logic programs
  via probability distributions over possible worlds. In our context, using the optimal transport entropy to inform predicate
  probabilities in ProbLog.
terms:
- term: Optimal Transport
  definition: >-
    A mathematical framework for finding the most efficient way to transform one probability distribution into another, minimizing
    a given cost function. In our context, it matches text terms to logic predicates with minimal semantic distance.
- term: Entropy-Regularized Optimal Transport
  definition: >-
    A variant of optimal transport that adds an entropy term to the optimization objective. The solution is computed via the
    Sinkhorn algorithm, and the entropy of the resulting transport plan provides a natural uncertainty measure.
- term: Predicate Grounding
  definition: >-
    The task of mapping natural language terms (words/phrases) to formal logical predicates. For example, mapping 'is a cat'
    to the predicate cat(X) in FOL.
- term: ProbLog
  definition: >-
    A probabilistic logic programming language where facts and rules have associated probabilities. It allows for uncertain
    reasoning by computing the probability of queries given the probabilistic program.
- term: Neuro-Symbolic Text-to-Logic Translation
  definition: >-
    The task of converting unstructured natural language text into a formal logical representation (e.g., FOL, Prolog) using
    both neural (LLM) and symbolic (logic solver) components.
- term: Sinkhorn Algorithm
  definition: >-
    An iterative algorithm for solving entropy-regularized optimal transport problems. It alternates between scaling rows
    and columns of the cost matrix to satisfy marginal constraints.
- term: Transport Plan
  definition: >-
    The solution to an optimal transport problem: a matrix where entry (i,j) indicates the amount of 'mass' transferred from
    source i to target j. In our context, it indicates how strongly text term i is assigned to predicate j.
- term: Transport Plan Entropy
  definition: >-
    The Shannon entropy of the transport plan, treated as a probability distribution. High entropy = uncertain matching (mass
    spread across many predicates). Low entropy = confident matching (mass concentrated on one predicate).
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes using entropy-regularized optimal transport to formulate predicate grounding as a matching problem
  between text terms and logic predicates. The entropy of the optimal transport plan provides a principled uncertainty measure
  that is integrated into probabilistic logic programming (ProbLog) for uncertainty-aware reasoning. This reduces hallucinations
  while maintaining interpretable reasoning traces.

objective: >-
  Acquire and prepare benchmark datasets for evaluating neuro-symbolic text-to-logic translation, specifically RuleTaker and
  CLUTRR datasets with short documents and multi-hop reasoning requirements.
approach: >-
  Search HuggingFace Hub and academic sources for RuleTaker (Clark et al., 2020) and CLUTRR (Sinha et al., 2019) datasets.
  Download, standardize to JSON format with fields: {document, facts, queries, answers, metadata}. Create full/mini/preview
  splits. Validate that documents are ~3000 characters and contain multi-hop reasoning tasks. Also search for any existing
  predicate grounding datasets or annotated FOL translation datasets that could serve as additional evaluation.
depends_on: []
</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for dataset artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-06-15 04:11:11 UTC

```
### Goal

Develop an operational translation pipeline that converts unstructured
textual content (e.g., short legal documents, news articles, kids'
stories) into a formal first-order logic representation. The output
must be capable of (probabilistic) reasoning using a logic reasoner
(like Prolog), leveraging LLMs to dynamically resolve terminology,
concepts, and relations that are not well defined in the explicit text.

### Reviewer Scope

Limit the technical core to areas the reviewer can deeply evaluate.
Other fields are welcome for inspiration but should not host the
substantive contribution.

Reviewer-evaluable areas: semantic technologies, logic programming,
inductive logic programming, information retrieval, machine learning,
LLMs, deep learning, knowledge extraction, knowledge graphs,
reasoning, and text data analytics.

The pipeline should ingest a short document (approx. 3000 characters)
and parse it into a structured, computable format. Methods may combine
an LLM acting as a semantic translation engine (mapping natural text
to first-order logic or Prolog predicates), a running logic
interpreter (like SWI-Prolog) for symbolic execution, and the
integration of upper ontologies like OpenCyc to supply necessary
background structure and taxonomic grounding. Furthermore, an LLM
should be deployed as a probabilistic reasoning engine to handle fuzzy
unifications, semantic similarities, and logical gaps where strict
symbolic matching fails due to language ambiguity.

Evaluation must be rigorous and compare the neuro-symbolic pipeline
against purely neural baselines (e.g., standard RAG, chain-of-thought
prompting) on standard logical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., RuleTaker,
CLUTRR) or custom annotated datasets. It must specifically measure:
(i) the precision and recall of atomic fact extraction directly from
the original document, and (ii) the accuracy of multi-hop fact
extraction and logical deductions that require synthesizing explicit
document facts with implicit common-sense knowledge.

Outputs must provide human-auditable trace-graphs of the reasoning
steps to clearly demonstrate the logical path taken.

Constraints: The pipeline must be highly reproducible on any short,
professionally written documents. Inference must be executable on
commodity hardware, and the system must report a quantified reduction
in hallucination rates compared to raw LLM generation.

### Publication

Target ACL Knowledge Extraction track as the primary venue, with
EMNLP or specialized neuro-symbolic AI conference tracks (e.g., NeSy)
as fallback targets.

### Things to Avoid

Avoid simplistic propositional logic translations of the text. Avoid
purely neural black-box systems that lack interpretable reasoning
traces. The substantive contribution must be an operational, hybrid
method for reasoning with textual content that explicitly minimizes
hallucinations.
```

### [3] SKILL-INPUT — aii-web-tools · 2026-06-15 04:11:17 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-web-tools** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

## Contents

- Workflow (3-phase dataset discovery)
- Scripts (Search, Preview, Download)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: 3-Phase Dataset Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Datasets
Find datasets with metadata (configs, splits, features, sizes)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "sentiment analysis" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2: Preview Dataset (if promising)
Inspect metadata AND sample rows in one call
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k
```

### Phase 3: Download Dataset (if suitable)
Download after reviewing the preview
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

## Scripts

### Search HuggingFace Datasets (aii_hf_search_datasets.py)

Search and discover datasets on HuggingFace Hub.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "text classification" --limit 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel (venv activate does NOT work in parallel subshells):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --query {} --limit 3' ::: 'sentiment' 'classification' 'translation'
```

**Example output:**
```

Dataset 1: stanfordnlp/imdb
Downloads: 2,500,000 | Likes: 1,234
Description: Large Movie Review Dataset for binary sentiment classification...
Tags: text-classification, en, sentiment-analysis
```

**Result fields per dataset:**

Each entry in ``results`` carries:

- ``id`` / ``downloads`` / ``likes`` / ``tags`` / ``description`` — standard
  HF metadata
- ``has_loader_script`` (bool) — repo ships a top-level ``<repo>.py`` loader.
  ``datasets>=3`` won't run these directly; the dataset is reachable only
  via the Datasets Server's pre-converted parquet shards. Treat as a yellow
  flag.
- ``loadable`` (bool) — **prefer datasets where this is ``True``.** Means
  the dataset is reachable via *some* path: either native parquet (no
  script) or HF auto-converted the script's output to parquet. When
  ``False``, the script needs deps HF can't install (e.g. ``conllu``,
  custom audio decoders) and ``aii_hf_datasets__download_datasets`` will
  fail — pick a different candidate.

**Parameters:**

`--query` (optional)
- Search query string
- Example: `--query "sentiment analysis"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Maximum number of results (default: 5)

`--tags` (optional)
- Filter by tags (comma-separated)
- Format: `category:value`
- Examples: `language:en`, `task_categories:text-classification`

`--sort` (optional)
- Sort by field: `downloads`, `likes` (default: downloads)

**Tips:**
- Search displays full dataset metadata
- Use tags to filter: `--tags "language:en,task_categories:translation"`

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel. Use `eval {}` pattern when datasets need different flags (e.g. `--config`):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite 'eval {}' ::: '$PY $S openai/gsm8k --config main --split train' '$PY $S imdb --split train' '$PY $S squad --split train'
```

**Example output:**
```
Downloaded: openai/gsm8k

  train:
    Rows: 7,473
    Preview: temp/datasets/preview_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
    Mini: temp/datasets/mini_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
    Full: temp/datasets/full_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
```

**Parameters:**

`dataset_id` (required, positional)
- HuggingFace dataset ID
- Examples: `openai/gsm8k`, `imdb`

`--config` (optional)
- Dataset configuration/subset name
- Use preview to see available configs

`--split` (optional)
- Specific split to load (e.g., `train`, `test`)
- If not specified, loads all splits

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory (default: `temp/datasets/`)

**Output files (auto-saved):**
1. **Preview**: `preview_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **READ THIS** for quick inspection
2. **Mini**: `mini_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 full rows - for development/testing
3. **Full**: `full_{dataset}_{split}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - use as input path for code

**Tips:**
- Only read preview file directly with Read tool
- Mini and full are input paths for processing code

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

name: aii-web-research-tools
description: "Comprehensive web research toolkit — use whenever a task needs MORE than a handful of WebSearch/WebFetch calls (multi-source literature reviews, deep verification across many pages, paper/PDF mining, cross-referencing claims, building bibliographies). Not for single quick lookups — use raw WebSearch/WebFetch for those. Adds aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction over HTML or PDFs (arXiv, journals) with context windows, beyond what WebFetch's lossy summary returns. Trigger: any extensive/comprehensive/deep research task, literature review, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arxiv, paper, PDF, exact quote, methodology, table value, regex."

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-research-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
